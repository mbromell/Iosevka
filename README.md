# Brosevka font

This is a fork of the [Iosevka font](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka). I
wont re-document all the things on Iosevka, if you want to learn how to
customise this font or do different build types, refer to their docs and it will
be the same process here.

You can refer to [private-build-plans.toml](private-build-plans.toml) to see the
build config to see the specific changes from the original Iosevka font. The
main difference is that I made the font slightly wider so it's easier to read
(width of 600 instead of 500, most fonts are 600 wide and I prefer that width).
